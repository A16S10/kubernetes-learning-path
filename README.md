### 4.Understand KubeConfig File

As a DevOps engineer, it is important to become familiar with the Kubeconfig file. It is crucial for tasks such as setting up cluster authentication for CI/CD systems, providing cluster access to developers, and more.

A Kubeconfig file is a YAML file that stores information and credentials for connecting to a Kubernetes cluster. It is used by command-line tools such as kubectl and other client libraries to authenticate with the cluster and interact with its resources.

The Kubeconfig file can be used to store information for multiple clusters and users, allowing users to switch between different clusters and contexts easily. It is an important tool for managing access to and interacting with Kubernetes clusters.

Refer the follwing document to learn about Kubeconfig File in detail.

### 5.Understand Kubernetes Objects And Resources

In Kubernetes, an object is a persisted entity in the cluster that represents a desired state of the system. It is created and managed by the Kubernetes API server, and is stored in the etcd key-value store. Examples of Kubernetes objects include pods, services, and deployments.

A resource is a representation of a Kubernetes object that is exposed by the Kubernetes API. It is a way for clients to interact with and manipulate objects in the cluster. Resources are typically accessed through the Kubernetes API using HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, and DELETE.
